#Logistics Delivery Optimization Project

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing delivery times for a logistics company using a combination of SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI. The dataset contains critical features such as warehouse locations, shipment modes, customer interactions, and product attributes. The primary objective is to predict late deliveries and identify key factors contributing to delays, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve operational efficiency.

#Key Features
  •	Dataset Overview:
    o	Features: Warehouse block, shipment mode, customer interactions, product ratings, discounts, and weights.
    o	Target: Reached_on_Time_Y_N (Binary classification: Y = On Time, N = Late Delivery).
  •	Tools and Techniques:
    o	SQL: Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from the raw dataset.
    o	Excel: Leveraged for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
    o	Power BI: Created interactive dashboards for real-time data insights and visualization.
    o	Python: Built and evaluated machine learning models.
  •	Preprocessing Pipeline:
    o	Categorical encoding using OneHotEncoder.
    o	Standardization of numerical features for model optimization.
  •	Modeling:
    o	Developed a Linear Regression model to predict delivery delays.
    o	Evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
  •	Insights:
    o	Generated feature importance to identify key contributors to late deliveries.
    o	Recommended actionable strategies to enhance delivery timelines.
